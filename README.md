# TowersOfHanoi
Gives moves to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle using recursion.

# What are the Towers of Hanoi?
The Towers of Hanoi is a puzzle where a number of disks are stacked on top of each other 
on a pole, with the largest disk at the bottom and the smallest at the top. The aim of the
puzzle is to get all of the disks from the first pole to the last, with out having a larger
disk placed on top of a smaller one. This program can have any number of disks, but is limited
to three poles.
